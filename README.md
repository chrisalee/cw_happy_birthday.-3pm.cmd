You're part of a security research group investigating a malware campaign following a recent breach at A.C.M.E.com, where hackers obtained user data. While passwords were safely hashed, attackers now use stolen emails and birthdates to trick users into running malware.

Attackers send emails with attachments disguised as innocent files, timed around the victim's birthday. The attachments pretend to be related to the birthday event in some form: posing as a postcard with birthday wishes, as a package of photos from the party, or as a restaurant bill to split. These attachments exploit system features, such as hiding file extensions and using a Right-to-Left Override character (RTLO) in the filename. This conceals the true file type and can obfuscate part of the filename, making the malware appear harmless when viewed.

Obfuscation Techniques
Some operating systems have a setting to hide file extensions from users. This setting aims to enhance user experience by concealing potentially confusing technical details from non-technical users. On a computer with this option enabled, for instance, a file named cute_kittens.jpg would have its extension hidden, with only its name, cute_kittens, being visible.

However, even if the extensions are hidden in folders, they can still be visible when showing attachments in email clients or browsers. Thatâ€™s why the attackers use an additional obfuscation technique: Right-to-Left Override.

The Right-to-Left Override marker is a special Unicode character with code U+202E, capable of producing confusing effects. When present in a filename visible in a folder on a system using a left-to-right locale, the name can be presented misleadingly: anything preceding the marker is displayed normally, the marker itself is not displayed, and anything following the marker is displayed in reverse.

When both features are exploited by a malware author, a user can be tricked into running malware on their machine while they believe they are opening a legitimate, innocent file:

You might think that icons would give away the whole trick, right? Unfortunately, icons can be easily changed too! However, changing icons is beyond the scope of this challenge.

Task
To further investigate the malware campaign, you need to create a function that mimics the method of the attack and simulates the operating system. It should accept a crafted, malicious name and return the name users would see in their folder, with the extension hidden and applying the confusing effect of the Right-to-Left Override marker.

The campaign targets users from Europe, and you can assume that users will have their computers initially set to a left-to-right language.

Examples
An example malware file to be distributed is an executable named birthday_balloons.[RTLO]gpj.exe. When it's viewed in a folder, the following sequence of events will occur:

First, the RTLO character will obfuscate the file name, presenting the part following it in reverse, resulting in the visible file name birthday_balloons.exe.jpg.
Afterwards, the file extension will be hidden by the operating system, leaving the visible portion as birthday_balloons.jpg.
Rules
Input filenames will always have exactly one RTLO character. It can be placed anywhere in the filename except in the real extension.
Filenames can contain one or more dots. Only the part after the last dot constitutes an extension and is hidden.
